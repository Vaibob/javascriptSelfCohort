# Internal and External Linking with JavaScript

This repository demonstrates the concept of internal and external linking of JavaScript code in an HTML document. We'll explore how to run the code and understand the concepts behind it.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need:

- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the ZIP file and extracting it.

2. **Navigate to the Folder:** Open the repository folder in your chosen code editor.

3. **Open `index.html`:** Inside the folder, you'll find an `index.html` file. Open it in your web browser by either double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your browser.

4. **Access Console:** With the web page open, right-click on the page and select "Inspect" (or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the browser's developer tools. Navigate to the "Console" tab.

5. **Observe Output:** As you load the page, you will see messages appearing in the console.

## Code Explanation

### `index.html`

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>JS Linking</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>This is an example of internal and external linking. Check the Console</h2>
        <!-- External Linking -->
        <script src="script.js"></script>

        <!-- Internal Linking -->
        <script>
            console.log("Hey, I am internally linked");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

In this HTML file, we have two `<script>` tags, each containing JavaScript code. 

1. The first `<script>` tag uses the `src` attribute to link to an external JavaScript file named `script.js`. This is an example of **external linking**. The code in `script.js` will be executed in the order it's linked.

2. The second `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code directly. This is an example of **internal linking**. The code inside this tag will be executed immediately when the browser encounters it.

### `script.js`

```javascript
console.log("This is External link");
```

The `script.js` file contains a single line of JavaScript code that logs a message to the console.

## Concepts Explained

- **External Linking:** By using the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute, we can link an external JavaScript file to our HTML document. This keeps our code organized and reusable.

- **Internal Linking:** Placing JavaScript code directly inside a `<script>` tag allows for quick execution of small code snippets.

- **Console:** The "Console" is a tool provided by web browsers that allows developers to view messages and errors generated by JavaScript code. It's an essential tool for debugging and understanding code behavior.

## Conclusion

By following the steps above, you've successfully run the provided code that demonstrates the concepts of internal and external linking of JavaScript code in an HTML document. Feel free to experiment with the code and explore further!
